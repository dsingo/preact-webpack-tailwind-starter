# Typescript + Preact + Webpack + Tailwindcss Starter

## Purpose

Here is the starter build system I use for my preact projects. I like to experiment with all sorts of technology like web workers and wasm, which all require a great deal of configuration, so my preference is for a build system that can be configured.

## Building and Developing

Creating a production build is done using the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

Developing with a live server is done as follows:

```bash
npm run start
```
